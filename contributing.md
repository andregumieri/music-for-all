## The Webapp
The interface to listen to music. 

## Generator
The interface so everyone can generate webapps with musics of their choice

## API
The API so the generator can connect to

# Contributing
I don't see why impose too much rules. This is colaborative and the main point is to help as many as possible. But I believe that some key points are important to follow:

1. Communications in this repository must be in english. I'm not saying that because I want to exclude people, but because english is the language that will reach most of the developers out there. And also because Google Translate does a pretty good job translating english. 
2. Internationalization. You will notice that the interface has so little text in it. That's to make as accessible as possible. It's a simply column of artists and them the albuns, each one with a play button. With that said, every UX idea that can improve it is welcome. 

**Also, it's pretty important to take a look at the [premisses of the project](https://github.com/andregumieri/music-for-all/wiki/Premisses)**
