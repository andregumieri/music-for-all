## Generator

# Contributing
I don't see why impose too much rules. This is colaborative and the main point is to help as many as possible. But I believe that some key points are important to follow:

1. Communications in this repository must be in english. I'm not saying that because I want to exclude people, but because english is the language that will reach most of the developers out there. And also because Google Translate does a pretty good job translating english. 
2. Internationalization. You will notice that the interface has so little text in it. That's to make as accessible as possible. It's a simply column of artists and them the albuns, each one with a play button. With that said, every UX idea that can improve it is welcome.
